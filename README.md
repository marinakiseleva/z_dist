# dist_code Background
Source code contributing to the research of the Transient Host Exchange (THEx) at the University of Arizona. We classify astronomical transients using host-galaxy photometric data, so that transients detected by the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) may be immediately followed-up on after their initial discovery based on their classified type. The main project is here: [thex_model](https://github.com/marinakiseleva/thex_model/)


This package is designed for comparing the data distributions of THEx dataset versus that of PLASTICCS. It assumes data lives in the DATA_DIR defined in estimate/constants.py and compares the distributions of THEx data versus PLASTICCS, and compares their t-SNE reductions.
